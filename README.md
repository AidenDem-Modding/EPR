# Evolved Police Response (EPR)
## About
Evolved Police Response is an immersive police mod which aims to improve the police in various different ways. It improves their behaviour and the way they act, it makes it so police now remembers who you are and makes the police a bigger challenge in general.
## Main Features
- Overhauls police chases and makes it more challenging and realistic. (By Adding in Lethal Force, etc...)
- Adds in player recognition systems which allows police to recognize the player after a chase has passed. (If the police saw the player during a chase of course)
- Adds in a stolen vehicle system, which allows police to look for stolen vehicles and make you wanted based on it.
- Adds in police patrols that happen all around Los Santos and the surrounding area. (Optional)
- Adds in an entire new roadblock system for after you have escaped a chase. It attempts to block you in and prevent you from leaving the area. (Optional, WIP)
And more!
- Adds in fully functioning CCTV cameras. (Optional)
- Adds in Rooftop Snipers like in Grand Theft Auto IV. (Optional, WIP)
- Adds in a Martial Law System where you can make it so the Military patrols the streets instead of police officers. (Optional, WIP)
- Adds in a way for you to choose custom loadouts for police officers, etc... on a per wanted level base. (Optional)
